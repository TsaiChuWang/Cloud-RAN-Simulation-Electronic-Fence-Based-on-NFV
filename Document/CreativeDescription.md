# Creative Description

Based on the following sections, we propose that the electronic fence modelling is different from others.
1. **The implementation of multiple communication models***
    Different communication models are dynamically adopted to suit different scenarios. The diagram below shows the basis for our classification (path loss, as antenna power depends on the hardware).
2. the implementation of geometric range fences
3. a fully 3GPP compliant simulation system
4. implementation of warning systems
5. An architecture that takes advantage of 5G features
